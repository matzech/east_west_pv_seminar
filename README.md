# README

This repository is designed for simulating East-West photovoltaic (PV) configurations using Python and PV simulation tools for an educational purpose.It is designed to guide users through the process of modeling and analyzing PV systems, with a focus on improving the system friendliness of PV installations. It serves as an educational tool for students and enthusiasts eager to learn the basics of PV modeling and explore the unique benefits of East-West PV configurations.

# Installation

You can install the libraries by typing the following command in the terminal

``
python setup.py install
``

# Usage
All necessary code is within the jupyter notebooks. They provide starter codes to make it easier for you and speed up. The order in which you should view the notebooks is indicated by the first number. It makes the most sense to start with 0, as each notebook builds upon the previous one.


To start the jupyter notebook with jupyter-lab, simply put 

``
jupyter-lab
``

or in case you want to use jupyter

``
jupyter notebook
``

in the command-line.
